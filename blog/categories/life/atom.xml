    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes I wonder about how life expands beyond my expectations. It&rsquo;s already start of February in 2017. I cannot catch the pace of intensive work. But why hustle? <!--more-->Life should be flow like milk from silver spoon, not waterfall. It&rsquo;s still start of 2017. I met interesting people from different places. I went to places I&rsquo;ve never been to. I had chance that I&rsquo;ve never imagined. I also fucked up things.</p>

<p>Lack of motivation could be a huge problem at the start of 2017. It&rsquo;s gonna be a rough start. But I think I&rsquo;m confident enough to manage it.</p>

<p>Think bigger.
Be proactive.
Stay positive.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Midnight is a good time just for blah blah. One 500ml Kölsch is not enough to make me tipsy, but the weather is. Summer night is one of my favorite time to start thinking and writing stuff. This time, I&rsquo;ll quote some scripts from a movie I just saw.<!--more--></p>

<p>At the end of last year, I talked with a friend of mine about the current status I&rsquo;m in. Surprisingly I found myself to be in the way of developing a pattern of consistently getting better, no matter at relationships, or life perspectives.</p>

<blockquote><p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking that the time we have to be single, is really the time we have to get good at being alone. But, how good at being alone do we really want to be? Isn&rsquo;t there a danger that you&rsquo;ll get so good at being single, so set in your ways that you&rsquo;ll miss out the chance to be with somebody great? Some people take baby steps to settle down. Some people refuse to settle at all. Sometimes, it&rsquo;s not statistics. It&rsquo;s just chemistry. And sometimes, just because it is over, doesn&rsquo;t mean the love ends. The thing about being single is, you should cherish it. Because, in a week, or a lifetime of being alone, you may get only one moment. One moment, when you&rsquo;re not tied up in a relationship with anyone. A parent, a pet, a sibling, a friend. One moment, when you stand on your own. Really, truely single. And then, it&rsquo;s gone.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Time flies. I can&rsquo;t believe that this is the first phrase that I come up with when I start to write this blog. But somehow it reflects what I feel these days. It has been one month and a half since my internship. Every week is like a flying arrow, throwing me from Monday to Friday.<!--more--></p>

<p>Almost half of 2016 has passed, I think it&rsquo;s time to do a retrospect and also some tweaking on the new year resolution that I made in January. Everything seems to be on track, except the photo shooting project. The probelem is that I don&rsquo;t have much time to contact partners to do this project, which is kind of the most important part of the theme 「parallel world」. Instead, I accidentally start a serie of photos named like 「Some XXX」, which includes the photos I&rsquo;ve taken before and some re-editing. Besides, I also had the chance to know a bunch of interesting people from Instagram. Maybe I should change the direction of the project to street photography first. Recently I&rsquo;ve been inspired by a guy named Erik Kim, who really like to share the experience during his shooting on streets. And great people skills also. I find this kind of project maybe doable, for example, 「Faces in Aachen」or something.</p>

<p>Lack of motivation is the biggest problem I&rsquo;ve been facing recently. I find it to be related to multitasking. When I assign so many tasks to myself at once, I sometimes get confused about the priorities of different tasks. This can be a source of procrastination, which means you cannot decide which ones to do first, you don&rsquo;t start at all.</p>

<p>That would be all. Set up the daily routine and get the machine running!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the very start of 2016, I&rsquo;ve made a new year resolution list. Doing a photo-shooting project is one of them. Inspired by many photographers, I think doing a long-term project is kinda cool. Because as one German proverb goes, Anfangen ist leicht, Beharren eine Kunst, which means, starting is easy, but persistence is an art. <!--more--></p>

<p>The idea &lsquo;Parallel World&rsquo; comes from one of my favorite writers, Haruki Murakami, who wrote many of his novels in parallel. This thing about difference and coherence between different space and time really interest me. Just imagine, at 5pm, I just get out of work, cooking dinner in the kitchen while drinking some beer. In the mean time, in the parallel world, somebody is reading a bedtime book or doing other crazy things.</p>

<p>Photography is all about telling stories. By combining the photos taken in two separate while consistent world, may intriging some fantastic sparkles. That&rsquo;s the initiation.</p>

<p>However, still finding interesting people to work with, but certainly will deliver.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After getting into college, my life starts on a flying mode. This freaks me out sometimes. That’s why I tend to make plans for everything I might want to do in the next period. Although some of them did not goes out as I planned or expected, but as the saying goes, 「Never go out there without a solid plan.」<!--more--></p>

<p>2015 turned out to be not so great for me. I believe that I messed up things a little bit. With the freedom here I got in German university, I kinda loosen up a bit. And this is definitely have bad influence on me. There are some milestoney events like, breaking up with my girlfriend, passing all exams and getting a internship in the God-forsaken blackforest. For the first half in 2015, I was pretty not happy about it. My whole living routine was struggling with thesis and science projects in college, that was a huge dose of anxiety. The later half turned out a little bit better. I finally passed the toughest exams and got a internship. Big events here is moving, I think, both spatially and spiritually. I had to face the fact that I live alone in the blackforest now and it is perfect for one to do some deep thinking, to literally figure out what’s next and cut out all the unrealistic delusions. Sort of self-sustained in the later half, that’s the big accomplishments for me.</p>

<p>2016 is a big year for me. This is the year I’m really starts thinking about getting 30 would look like, which means I really should not just go with the flow and play around and stuff. This is the time that I should plan the so called “future”. What I really want to do with my life, something to be considered such as career. Besides, I believe my life-long partner is still out there waiting for me to find. So, let’s talk about resolutions.</p>

<p>In the new year, I wish I could accomplish the following things in my life.</p>

<blockquote><p>Graduate</p>

<p>Get a job</p>

<p>Learn to do handstand</p>

<p>Contact more with friends and family</p>

<p>Starting a photo-shooting project</p></blockquote>
