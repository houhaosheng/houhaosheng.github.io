    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Everything is a pattern. This sound a little bit cliche. But to be honest, cliche is the thing that always stay true. A way a person behaves can be a pattern. The way that an organization works can be a pattern. This could goes to the working efficiency area. And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to say in this article.<!--more--></p>

<p><em>Noizio</em> is an Application that I&rsquo;m using to developing my working pattern. It has a lot of scenes of sound built in it. For example, October Rain, Coffee House, Wind Chimes and so on. You can also save your favorite composition so you can easily reuse it. For me, I usually use two patterns, daywork and nightwork. The daywork pattern is composed of Coffee House and Wind Chimes, because I really like the noise in the coffee house while working. Don&rsquo;t ask why, I&rsquo;m weird. The nightwork pattern is composed of Thundstorm and Campfire. This always reminds me of a scene in the cave, very cozy and warm, however, it rains pretty hard outside. Besides, the sound of fire always reminds me of my childhood spent in my grandma&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>In iOS, there&rsquo;s a similar App called <em>Taomix</em>. I barely use it because I always on my Mac while I&rsquo;m working. But this App works as good as the aforementioned one, or even better. Becasue in this App you can actually define the distance of each sound source from you. I&rsquo;ve got admit that this is pretty damn cool.</p>

    <id>http://houhaosheng.github.io/blog/auto-sleeping-in-win10</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://omuoa05ah.bkt.clouddn.com/win10.png" alt="Windows10" /></p>

<p>A couple of months ago, I installed Win10 Education on my old laptop to make it a backup computer at home. But I haven&rsquo;t use it very often until today. And yet I discovered a problem that I never run into before. <!--more-->My laptop goes to sleep every 2 minutes if you don&rsquo;t operate anything. Thinking like a normal person, I certainly goes to the system setting to change the sleep option to 「Never」. Am I too naive? It turns out that I am. Changing the settings won&rsquo;t make a difference in this case.So, a little research being made and here goes the solution.</p>

<ol>
<li>Press 「WIN+r」, type in 「regedit.exe」</li>
<li><p>Locate to the following path:</p>

<pre><code> HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Power\
 PowerSettings\238C9FA8-0AAD-41ED-83F4-97BE242C8F20\
 7bc4a2f9-d8fc-4469-b07b-33eb785aaca0   
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Change the value of 「Attributes」to 2</p></li>
<li>Press 「WIN+x」, go to 「Control Panel」->「System and Security」->「Power Options」->「Change advanced power settings」->「Sleep」->「System unattended sleep timeout」, change the time to whatever you want.</li>
</ol>


<p>Tada! Problem solved.</p>

    <id>http://houhaosheng.github.io/blog/markdown-is-the-new-sexy</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Markdown is a lightweight markup language developed by John Gruber(so says Wikipedia). My first contact with markdown is the time I build this personal blog website. All the blogs I&rsquo;ve written is in markdown format. This is a pretty cool and most of all distraction-free way of writing articles.<!--more--></p>

<p>But first of all, when you write something, editor is necessary. There are countless editors, well, that&rsquo;s exaggerative expression. Luckily, I only tried out three before I found my favorite one. The first one I tried is <em>Mou</em> developed by this great guy <em>Chen Luo</em>. It&rsquo;s completely free and easy to use. But the only thing that turn me down is the coloring, way too colorful for me. The second one is <em>Ulysses</em>, said to be the most powerful markdown tools on the market. Well, for me, maybe too powerful. I don&rsquo;t really need all the file directory stuff. Besides, the downside of powerful is that it&rsquo;ll definitely become slower. So comes the third one, my favorite, <em>Byword</em>. It&rsquo;s small, single-functional. Just the way I like it, full &lsquo;minimalism&rsquo; design.</p>

<p>There are already tons of tutorials on the internet about markdown grammar. However, I&rsquo;ll write another simple one and post it later, just as a reminder for me to check when I forget about something. But if this can be a little help of you guys, I&rsquo;ll be glad.</p>

    <updated>2015-11-15T03:02:05+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://houhaosheng.github.io/blog/setup-workflow-on-mac</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As this may sounds familier to all of you: before I start doing my work, I just use 5 minutes to check out the new post on Facebook or Twitter. And a hour has passed, you are kind of &ldquo;stuck to&rdquo; the virtual circle of intersting things. This happens to me all the time. Works are always be postponed, things remain undone, life sucks.<!--more--></p>

<p>I think the most exciting and frustrating thing about Mac is that, you don&rsquo;t need to shut down. If you were social-networking, the next time you open up you Mac, you will directly be in the same status. However, if you think on the opposite way, you will discover that the work you left there yesterday are still there. Instead of seeing social network page on the first sight, you will continue to do your work instantly.</p>

<p>Workflow maybe the best thing I could think of to avoid distraction. With one click or type in the terminal some command, you will quickly pick up the work you left and get in the mood of working.Here goes how:</p>

<p>The workflow to quit all Applications:</p>

<blockquote><ol>
<li><p>Open Automator and choose workflow</p></li>
<li><p>In the Library, choose Utilities, then drag 「Quit all Applications」to the right</p></li>
<li><p>If you wanna keep some App open, just hit 「Add current Applications」</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>The workflow to open certain bundle of Applications is basically the same procedure, one can explore a little bit.</p>

<p>cmd+s to save the work flow and just pin it somewhere handy, dock seems to be a excellent choice.  Or if you prefer the using of Terminal, you can type in the following command:</p>

<pre><code>automator yourworkflow.workflow
</code></pre>

<p>in the path where you saved your workflow.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also a tip for setting workflow. You have to know exactly what you gonna do with your Mac, probably write all the Application you need and the sequence maybe on Notes, and then set up the workflow. As always, with explicit target, you can avoid wasting time.</p>
